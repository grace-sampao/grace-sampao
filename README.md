## 🏗️ The Pivot: Structural Thinking Meets AI

I'm currently an architect by trade, in the process of an ambitious and self-driven pivot into **Data Science and AI**. My years in construction honed my skills in **structural integrity**, **complex problem-solving**, and **visualizing abstract concepts**—qualities I now apply to data models and algorithmic systems.

I am an enthusiast and student of:
* **📐 Mathematics:** The core language of AI. I am engaged in deep self-study, with the goal of eventually pursuing a second undergraduate degree in the field.
* **💻 Programming:** Focusing on Python, ML/DL frameworks, and clean, efficient code for data solutions.
* **🎨 Computational Art:** Merging design aesthetics with algorithms to create powerful, elegant data visualizations and models.
